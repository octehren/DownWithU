# DownWithU
Youtube downloader. Uses yt-dlp as core library.

It consists of two apps: a FastAPI backend and a React front-end. Both should be able to run by themselves (though the front-end would be kind of useless).

See the back-end's specific README under the `be_downwithu` directory, same for the front-end.
